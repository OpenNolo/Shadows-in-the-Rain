# Shadows-in-the-Rain
In this project the user can investigate the paths that hurricanes take, related to the time of year and their destructive potential. The web application helps the user investigate where are the most likely places for hurricanes to strike, where the most damaging hurricanes strike, seasonal variation, and trends over time. The application fits well on huge screen (Presented on a 8196 x 2188 Touch Screen).
